## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

always read your design before starting your code. it be easier if you analyze it.
 > the challange has 3 containers and the containers contain mostly similar design so I dont need to design all over again. target it by class and it's all done. that's why you should analyze it first.

### Continued development

wanna try BEM Methodology hehehehheeh, I think it will be fun and make my code cooler :p

### Useful resources

i've been busy with college but still trying to use myspare time to learn. and
this [Junior Webdev Checklist](https://youtu.be/p1zJExpDvxs) really helped me to know what do I need to learn, it saves my time and I didn't get overwhelmed.
